Always teaching me how to be
When your folks are not here to see
You crashing on the floor with me
But I can't sleep
And I don't wanna know
You've found another place to go
I copy everything practical
And for the last time I am sure
Ooh ooh, ooh
You are not alone
Ooh ooh
For the last time I am sure
Ooh ooh, ooh
You are not alone
Ooh ooh
For the last time I am sure
Hey
I know what to feel when you decide, oh why?
Hey
Where is the appeal when you don't try, try?
It's your only way to live
Three doors down and one room in
I lose my mind amongst your things
But I can't swim
It's the same, it's just like then
When I was nine and you were ten
I'm wishing we would still be friends
Where we move is where we end
Ooh ooh, ooh
You are not alone
Ooh ooh
For the last time I am sure
Ooh ooh, ooh
You are not alone
Ooh ooh
For the last time I am sure
Hey
I know what to feel when you decide, oh why?
Hey
Where is the appeal when you don't try, try?
But I can't swim
But I can't swim
But I can't swim
But I can't swim
Hey
I know what to feel when you decide, oh why?
Where is the appeal when you don't try, try?
Hey
I know what to feel when you decide, oh why?
Hey
Where is the appeal when you don't try, try?
